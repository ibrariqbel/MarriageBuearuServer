## üß™ Testing the Payment System

### 1. Create a Membership Plan (Super Admin)

First, ensure you have membership plans created. If not, create one:

```bash
# This requires the membershipPlan model and routes to be implemented
# For now, you can manually insert into MongoDB:
db.membershipplans.insertOne({
  name: "Premium",
  price: 1000,
  duration: 30,
  features: ["Unlimited profiles", "Chat access", "Priority support"],
  createdAt: new Date()
})
```

### 2. User Uploads Payment Slip

```bash
# Login as user first
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/user/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "password123"
  }'

# Upload payment slip
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/payment/upload \
  -H "Cookie: token=USER_TOKEN" \
  -F "image=@payment-slip.jpg" \
  -F "membershipPlanId=PLAN_ID" \
  -F "amount=1000"
```

### 3. Admin Reviews Payment

```bash
# Login as admin
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/user/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "admin@example.com",
    "password": "admin123"
  }'

# View pending payments
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/payment/all?status=pending" \
  -H "Cookie: token=ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Approve payment
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/payment/approve/PAYMENT_ID \
  -H "Cookie: token=ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"remarks": "Approved"}'
```
